Original Twitter Post
Many people may not know this but this video by Sean Barrett @nothings is partially the reason why I made the Odin programming language.
And I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what insights it gave me in this thread ðŸ§µ.
A lot of these seem &amp;ldquo;so obvious&amp;rdquo; but for some reason it never clicked to me before this video. A lot of the &amp;ldquo;higher level&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;scripting&amp;rdquo; languages are not that much higher level than C.</description>
